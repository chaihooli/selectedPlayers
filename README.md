This program is developed as part of code-challenge.

Code Challenge1 : This is a program that takes the list of scores and the highest selection score as the input and gives you the number of selected player as the output.

1. Content of page is held in index.html
2. Styling of html elements is in style.css
3. All code logic for handling various scenarios is inside script.js file
